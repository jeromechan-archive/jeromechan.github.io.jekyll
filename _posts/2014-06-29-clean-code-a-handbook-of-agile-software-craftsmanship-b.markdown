  * “If you have experienced even one small part of the story I just told, then you already know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.” 


2. Attitude 



	
  * We are deeply complicit in the planning of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for any failures; especially if those failures have to do with bad code! 

	
  * The manager will defend the schedule and requirements with passion. And you, it’s absolutely your job to defend the code with equal passion. 

	
  * It’s unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes, too. 


<!-- more -->3. Temporary conclusion



	
  * “You will not make the deadline by making the mess.” 

	
  * The only right way to reach the goal---is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

5. What is clean code



	
  * Do you really know what is clean code? 

	
  * And what do the very well-known and deeply experienced programmers think about it? 


6. Bjarne Stroustrup(Inventor of C++)



	
  * "I like my code to be elegant and efficient.” 

	
  * “Clean code does one thing well.”

7. Grady Booch(Author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications)



	
  * “Clean code is simple and direct.”

8. Dave Thomas(”Founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy”)



	
  * “Clean code can be read.”

9. Michael Feathers(”Author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code”)



	
  * “clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.”

10. Ron Jeffries(“Author of Extreme Programming Installed”)



	
  * “Reduced duplication” 

	
  * “High expressiveness”

11. Ward Cunningham(“Inventor of Wiki”)



	
  * “You know you are working on clean code when each routine you reads turns out to be pretty much what you expected.”
