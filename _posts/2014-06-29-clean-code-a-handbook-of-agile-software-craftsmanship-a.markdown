  * Badly named variables 

	
  * Tens of classes 

	
  * Several packages 

	
  * “Board”, “Game”, “Strategy” classes

“Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements.”

9. Bad code



	
  * Kent Beck’s book Implementation Patterns. He says, “…this book is based on a rather fragile premise: that good code matters….” 

	
  * [![image](/images/2014-06-29-clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software-craftsmanship-a/image_thumb35.png)](/images/2014-06-29-clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software-craftsmanship-a/image35.png)1.“It was the bad code that brought the company down.”

2.“Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then---why did you write it?”

3.“LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.”


10. The total cost of owning a mess



	
  * No change is trivial 

	
  * The productivity of the team continues to decrease 

	
  * Add more new staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity 

	
  * There is no way at all in the end
